**adapter pattern** is, for instance, to work with some old code with a different interface.

let's assume that I have a round basket for my round toys
and I have a round toy. I put it inside the basket and it fits.

when I have another old toy, which is square.
if I put this old square toy into my round basket, 
it won't fit. 

**Because, round basket accepts _round toy only_. 
I cannot change it...**

**So, I create an adapter IMPLEMENTS round toy.**
and its constructor gets old square toy as a parameter.

_inside the adapter, I write my code to make them compatible._
